# Open Metadata

[Open Metadata](https://open-metadata.org/) which seems to be a competing standard with Egeria. There's a connector to support integration with [OpenLineage](../openlineage/README.md). Open Metadata seems to be associated with a [startup](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/collate), [Collate](https://www.getcollate.io/about) that has some key data engineering folks in their senior leadership team.
