# Open Data Product Specification

[Open Data Production Specification](https://opendataproducts.org/) also donated to Linux Foundation as well under the Bitol umbrella. In 2024, cross-standard support for ODCS was [announced](https://blog.opendataproducts.org/data-contract-support-added-to-open-data-product-specification-90b570ace1d7) to differentiate commonalities and differences between Data Contract vs Data Product.
