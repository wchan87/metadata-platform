# Open Data Contact Standard

[Open Data Contract Standard](https://bitol-io.github.io/open-data-contract-standard/v3.0.0/home/) donated to Linux Foundation as well under the Bitol umbrella. It evolved from the Data Contract Template open-sourced by PayPal (https://github.com/paypal/data-contract-template).

See [Data Contract CLI](https://cli.datacontract.com/) as a means to help with working with the ODCS. Note that Data Contract CLI supports Python 3.10 to 3.12 with Python 3.11 recommended.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate
pip install 'datacontract-cli[all]'
datacontract --version
```
