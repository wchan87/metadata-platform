# Open Data Contact Standard

[Open Data Contract Standard](https://bitol-io.github.io/open-data-contract-standard/v3.0.0/home/) donated to Linux Foundation as well under the Bitol umbrella. It evolved from the Data Contract Template open-sourced by PayPal (https://github.com/paypal/data-contract-template).
